# Active Context

## Current Development Focus

The current development focus for the Spinometer project is on **improving the UI and user experience**. This includes:

1. **UI Refinement**: Enhancing the visual design and layout of interface elements
2. **Interaction Improvements**: Making the application more intuitive and user-friendly
3. **Visualization Enhancements**: Improving how spine posture is displayed to users
4. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Refining how posture information is communicated

This focus on UI and user experience is critical for ensuring that the technical capabilities of the spine posture estimation are presented in a way that is accessible and valuable to end users.

## Recent Changes and Implementations

Based on the codebase examination, recent work appears to have included:

1. **Multiple Visualization Modes**: Implementation of different ways to view posture data:
   - WebCam only
   - Skeleton only
   - Stick figure only
   - Side by side
   - Overlayed

2. **Localization Support**: Addition of language options (English and Japanese)

3. **Warning Messages**: Implementation of status notifications for:
   - Tracking lost
   - Tracking unstable
   - Camera offline

4. **Calibration Workflow**: Refinement of the three-step setup process:
   - Camera selection
   - Angle calibration
   - Distance calibration

   - Create notification system for posture alerts

2. **Data Logging Foundation**:
   - Design data schema for posture history
   - Implement local storage mechanism
   - Create basic data export functionality

### Long-term Vision

As identified in project planning, the long-term goals include:

1. **Full Background Monitoring**:
   - Run in background with minimal UI
   - Continuous posture monitoring
   - Smart alerts when alignment exceeds thresholds

2. **Comprehensive Data Logging**:
   - Save alignment data to local and/or remote storage
   - Secure and efficient data management
   - Privacy-focused design

3. **Historical Data Review**:
   - Visualization of posture trends over time
   - Analytics and insights on posture patterns
   - Recommendations based on historical data

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### UI/UX Decisions

1. **Visualization Balance**: Finding the right balance between:
   - Technical accuracy in posture representation
   - User-friendly, intuitive visualization
   - Actionable feedback that promotes better posture

2. **Setup Simplification**: Evaluating whether the current three-step calibration process can be simplified without sacrificing accuracy

3. **Feedback Approach**: Determining the most effective way to communicate posture issues:
   - Real-time visual feedback
   - Numerical measurements
   - Color-coding and warnings
   - Potential audio cues

### Technical Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the application runs efficiently, especially with plans for background operation
   - Neural network inference frequency
   - Rendering optimizations
   - Memory management

2. **Calibration Accuracy**: Balancing ease of setup with measurement precision
   - Webcam field of view estimation
   - Distance calibration methodology
   - Angle reference points

3. **Cross-platform Potential**: Evaluating the feasibility of supporting platforms beyond Windows

### Future Feature Planning

1. **Background Service Architecture**: Designing how the application will function when minimized or running in the background
   - System tray integration
   - Startup options
   - Resource management

2. **Data Storage Strategy**: Planning for efficient and secure storage of posture history
   - Local vs. cloud storage
   - Data retention policies
   - Privacy considerations

3. **Analytics Capabilities**: Determining what insights can be derived from historical posture data
   - Trend identification
   - Pattern recognition
   - Correlation with time of day, activities, etc.

## Current Challenges

1. **Tracking Reliability**: Ensuring consistent face detection and tracking across different:
   - Lighting conditions
   - User positions
   - Webcam qualities

2. **Calibration Usability**: Making the setup process intuitive while maintaining accuracy

3. **Feedback Clarity**: Communicating posture information in a way that is:
   - Easy to understand
   - Actionable
   - Non-intrusive

4. **Resource Usage**: Balancing application performance with system resource consumption, particularly important for future background operation

## Integration Points

As development continues on UI improvements, careful attention must be paid to integration points with the core functionality:

1. **Visualization ↔ Algorithm**: How UI changes affect the display of algorithm outputs

2. **Settings UI ↔ Configuration**: Ensuring settings changes properly propagate to the underlying systems

3. **Calibration UI ↔ Measurement Accuracy**: Maintaining the precision of the calibration process while improving its usability

4. **Warning System ↔ Tracking Status**: Ensuring clear communication of tracking issues through the UI
